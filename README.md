This portfolio is a simple c code that allows a user to search the imdb database title.basics.tsv.gz  (downloadable at https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/
This database contains a large collection of films, videos and movies.

To use this program, simply download the database and unzip it into the same file as this.
Then just run the makefile and you will be confronted with a title screen with multiple options.

The screens are completely navigatable by arrow keys and the keyboard is used for select entries.
